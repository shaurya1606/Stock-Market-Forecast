# Stock Market Forecasting Application
 
This repository contains the source code for the **Stock Market Forecasting Application**, a Streamlit-based web app that allows users to analyze, visualize, and forecast stock market data. It provides interactive visualizations, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling for selected stock tickers.

---

## Features

### 1. **Interactive User Interface**

- **Start and End Date Selection:** Allows users to choose custom date ranges for stock data analysis.
- **Stock Ticker Selection:** Dropdown to select popular stock tickers like `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GOOG`, etc.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Includes line plots, summary statistics, and correlation heatmaps.

### 2. **Data Visualization**

- Multi-column data visualizations with Plotly.
- Heatmaps for exploring relationships between key metrics.
- Time-series decomposition to analyze trends, seasonality, and residuals.

### 3. **Statistical and Predictive Modeling**

- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity check.
- Seasonal decomposition of time-series data (trend, seasonality, residuals).
- SARIMAX model for forecasting stock prices with customizable parameters (`p`, `d`, `q`, and seasonal order).
- Predictions for future stock prices with visual comparisons between actual and predicted values.

### 4. **Customizable Parameters**

- Set values for the SARIMAX model’s hyperparameters (p, d, q, and seasonal order).
- Flexible forecasting period input.

### 5. **Responsive Design**

- Sidebar for parameter inputs and feature toggles.
- Dynamic resizing of visualizations for a responsive experience.

### 6. **About Section**

- Information about the developer.
- Links to connect on social media platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- A web browser (for running the Streamlit app)

---

## Installation and Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shauryasrivastava-1612/Stock-Market-Forecast.git
cd Stock-Market-Forecast
```

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Run the Application
Start the Streamlit app by running:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open in your default web browser. If not, navigate to http://localhost:8501.

## Technologies Used
- Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
- yFinance: For fetching historical stock market data.
- Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly: For data visualization.
- Statsmodels: For time-series analysis and forecasting.
- Python Libraries: Various utilities and dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

## Key Functionalities and Workflow
 ### 1. Data Retrieval:
  - Users select a company ticker and date range.
- Stock data is fetched using yfinance and displayed in an interactive table.
3## 2. Visualization:
- Users can select specific columns to visualize using line charts.
- Optional features like correlation heatmaps can be enabled.
### 3. Time Series Analysis:
- ADF test checks for stationarity.
- Seasonal decomposition splits data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
### 4. Predictive Modeling:
- Users customize SARIMAX model parameters.
- Predictions are generated and compared with actual data.
- Forecasting for user-specified future periods.
### 5. Interactive Forecasting:
- Graphs show both actual and predicted values side by side.
- Planned Enhancements
- Add support for more stock tickers or indices.
- Enhance model selection with automated hyperparameter tuning.
- Provide more user-friendly error handling for invalid inputs.
- Include additional forecasting models (e.g., LSTM, Prophet).
